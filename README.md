Bike survey Dashboard - Excel

analysis of the project :
We evaluated customers based on their ages, incomes, and communities. Middle-aged customers bought the most bikes overall.
Those who commute 0â€“1 miles likely to purchase more bikes than those who commute more than 10 miles. Also, we observed that purchasing the bike was 
significantly influenced by income.
